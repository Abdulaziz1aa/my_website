#I've had an interesting life

I grew up in the following places chronologically, Riyadh, Dammam, Kuwait, Abu Dhabi, Dammam, Beirut Dammam and now London while summering at Tripoli Lebanon. 

I got the chance to meet so many people, from all kinds of backgrounds, enriching my life and expoing to numerous cultures. 

I speak four languages, Arabic, English, French and Spanish.

I started the Engineering and Architecture faculty's first official magazine, which I ran for two years. I represented the university at three harvard MUN delegations at New York and Tokyo, winning the distinguished delegation award all three times. 

I started a socio-politcal grass root movement called Change Starts Here, one of the major organizations representing university students in Lebanon. 

I just finished my Master in Management at London Business School.
